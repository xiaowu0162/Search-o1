      "Even if I understand that this is a good approximation, I don't know which method should be used in order to derive this approximated solution from the original problem\n",
      "I tired zero order Taylor expansion, but the result is different, indeed expanding the field around $\\vec x_0$ and considering the zero order term:\n",
      "$$\\vec B(\\vec x)=\\vec B(\\vec x_0)$$\n",
      "So the equation of motion becomes\n",
      "$$\\frac {d \\vec v}{dt}=\\frac q m \\left[\\frac {\\vec v} c \\times \\vec B(\\vec x_0)\\right]$$\n",

      "Maybe I should use also the first order term but the equations doesn't look  promising.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==================================\n",
      "QwQ solution after thinking:\n",
      "\n",
      "To derive the approximate solution \\(\\vec{v}(t) = v_0 \\frac{\\vec{B}(\\vec{x})}{|\\vec{B}(\\vec{x})|}\\) for a charged particle in a slowly varying magnetic field, we can use the concept of adiabatic invariants. Here are the key steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Equation of Motion**:\n",
      "   The equation of motion for a charged particle in a magnetic field is:\n",
      "   \\[\n",
      "   \\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} = \\frac{q}{m} \\left[ \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\times \\vec{B}(\\vec{x}) \\right]\n",
      "   \\]\n",
      "   where \\(\\vec{v}\\) is the velocity of the particle and \\(\\vec{B}(\\vec{x})\\) is the magnetic field.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Assumption of Slowly Varying Magnetic Field**:\n",
      "   We assume that the magnetic field \\(\\vec{B}(\\vec{x})\\) varies slowly in space and time compared to the cyclotron frequency of the particle. This allows us to use the adiabatic invariance approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Magnetic Moment Invariance**:\n",
      "   The magnetic moment \\(\\mu\\) is an adiabatic invariant given by:\n",
      "   \\[\n",
      "   \\mu = \\frac{m v_\\perp^2}{2B}\n",
      "   \\]\n",
      "   where \\(v_\\perp\\) is the perpendicular component of the velocity. If the particle starts with no perpendicular velocity (\\(v_\\perp = 0\\)), \\(\\mu = 0\\), which remains (approximately) conserved. This implies that any perpendicular velocity remains negligible and the particle continues moving along the magnetic field lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Parallel Velocity Conservation**:\n",
      "   For a particle moving along the magnetic field direction, the parallel velocity \\(v_{\\parallel}\\) is conserved (to leading order in the adiabatic regime). This is because the parallel momentum is conserved in the absence of perpendicular forces (to first order).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Resulting Solution**:\n",
      "   Combining these observations, the particle's velocity remains aligned with the local magnetic field direction, \\(\\vec{B}(\\vec{x})/|\\vec{B}(\\vec{x})|\\), and its magnitude \\(v_0\\) remains constant. Thus, the approximate solution is:\n",
