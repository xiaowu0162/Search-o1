    thinking = (" so I need to figure out which transition path and probability is correct for the decay from |3,0,0\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9 via two dipole transitions. Let me start by recalling some quantum mechanics here. \n\nFirst, dipole transitions are electric dipole (E1) transitions, right? And the selection rules for E1 transitions require that the angular momentum changes by \u0394l = \u00b11 and \u0394m = 0 or \u00b11. Also, the total angular momentum change has to satisfy certain conditions. Wait, but for hydrogen, since there's no orbital angular momentum for the electron except what comes from the electron's own motion, the selection rules are straightforward.\n\nThe problem states it's a two-step decay. So the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. It must go through an intermediate state before reaching the final state |1,0,0\u27e9. The options give different paths and probabilities. Let me go step by step using the hints provided.\n\nThe hint says: For l=0 \u2192 0 cascade via two steps, follow four points. Let me parse that.\n\na) The l sequence must have two \u0394l = \u00b11 jumps. Since starting at l=0, going to some intermediate l, then to l=0 again. So possible sequences?\n\nWait, starting at l=0, the first transition must have \u0394l = \u00b11. But since l can't be negative, the first transition must go to l=1. Then from l=1, the second transition must go back to l=0 (since the final l is 0). So the intermediate state must have l=1. That makes sense. So the first transition is from l=0 to l=1, and the second from l=1 to l=0. So all the paths given in the options must involve an intermediate state with l=1. Looking at the options:\n\nOption A and D have the intermediate as |2,1,0\u27e9, which is l=1, m=0.\n\nOptions B and C have the intermediate as |2,1,-1\u27e9 and |2,1,1\u27e9 respectively. So all of them have l=1, so that part is okay.\n\nNow moving to point b): list every m' that the first E1 step can access (\u0394m = 0, \u00b11). The initial m is 0, so possible m values after first transition would be m'=0\u00b10, 0\u00b11? Wait, \u0394m can be 0, +1, or -1. So starting from m=0, the possible m' after the first transition (from l=0 to l=1) would be m'=0+0=0, 0+1=1, or 0-1=-1. Therefore, the first transition could lead to m' being 0, 1, or -1 in the intermediate state.\n\nSo the intermediate states allowed for the first step would be |n', l=1, m=0\u27e9, |1\u27e9, |-1\u27e9. However, the options only have m values of 0, -1, or 1. The given options for the intermediate states are m=0 (A and D), m=-1 (B), and m=1 (C). So all three possibilities are covered in the options.\n\nNext, point c) use Clebsch-Gordan factors to divide the amplitude among those m's. Hmm. Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients come into play when combining angular momenta. Here, maybe we need to consider the matrix elements for the dipole transition, which involve the integral over the wavefunctions, and the angular part depends on the product of the initial and final angular wavefunctions multiplied by the dipole operator, which has angular dependence involving spherical harmonics. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transition probability is proportional to the square of the sum over m' of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients? Wait, maybe I should recall that the probability amplitude for a dipole transition between two states involves the integral \u27e8f | r | i \u27e9, which can be expressed in terms of the reduced matrix element and the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the angular part. \n\nSpecifically, the angular part of the dipole transition matrix element between states |n l m\u27e9 and |n' l' m'\u27e9 is proportional to the integral over angles of Y_{l'm'}(\u03b8,\u03c6)* r Y_{lm}(\u03b8,\u03c6). But since the radial part includes r, the angular integral becomes \u222b Y_{l'm'}^* Y_{l m} * r^2 d\u03a9? Wait, actually, the radial parts would separate, so the angular part is \u222b Y_{l'm'}^*(\u03b8,\u03c6) Y_{l m}(\u03b8,\u03c6) sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6 multiplied by something else. \n\nBut perhaps more importantly, the matrix element for the dipole transition between states with angular momentum l and l' must obey the selection rules. The angular part of the dipole operator is proportional to the vector spherical harmonics, which have components with \u0394l = \u00b11 and \u0394m = 0, \u00b11. So the transition is allowed if l' = l \u00b11 and m' = m, m\u00b11. \n\nTherefore, the first transition from |3,0,0\u27e9 must go to a state with l'=1, and m'=0, 1, or -1. Each of these has a certain probability amplitude. To find the probability, we need to compute the square of the matrix element for each possible m', and then see how they contribute when followed by the second transition.\n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficients might come into play when considering the combination of angular momenta, but maybe here it's simpler to note that the probability for each m' is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for that transition. Alternatively, perhaps the amplitude for each m' is determined by the Wigner-Eckart theorem. \n\nLet me think of the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The matrix element \u27e8n', l', m' | r | n, l, m \u27e9 can be written as:\n\n\u27e8n', l', m' | r | n, l, m \u27e9 = \u27e8 l' m' | l m \u27e9_r * \u27e8n' l' || r || n l \u27e9,\n\nwhere \u27e8 l' m' | l m \u27e9_r is the reduced matrix element, and the other term is the radial part. But the angular part here would involve the integral over the angular coordinates, which is related to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients? Or perhaps the integral over the product of spherical harmonics with the dipole moment's angular dependence.\n\nWait, the dipole operator is a vector, so its angular part can be represented in terms of spherical harmonics. Specifically, the dipole moment operator has components like e r Y_{1 m}(\u03b8,\u03c6), so when taking the matrix element between states, the angular part becomes \u222b Y_{l'm'}^* Y_{1 m''} Y_{lm} d\u03a9, where m'' is the component of the dipole operator's angular part. Hmm, this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the selection rule's probability distribution for m' is symmetric, so each allowed m' has equal probability?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transition probabilities for different m' values are the same because of symmetry. For instance, when transitioning from m=0 to m'=0, \u00b11, maybe each has the same probability? Because the initial state has m=0, and the dipole transition can couple to m'=0, +1, -1 equally, due to the symmetry around the z-axis. \n\nWait, but actually, the dipole operator has components in x, y, z directions. The z-component (which would correspond to m=0) would couple m to m', while the x and y components (which have m=\u00b11) would allow transitions between m and m\u00b11. So the total transition probability would involve contributions from all these components. \n\nHowever, the probability for each m' might depend on the relative weights of these components. Let me think of the matrix element squared for each possible m'. Suppose the dipole transition matrix element from |3,0,0\u27e9 to |2,1,m'\u27e9 is proportional to some factor depending on m'. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total probability is spread equally among the three possible m' states (m'= -1, 0, +1) because of symmetry. Since the initial state has m=0, the transition probabilities for m'= -1, 0, +1 might each have the same probability. \n\nAssuming that, then the first transition would split the amplitude equally into the three m' states. However, when proceeding to the next step, not all of those m' states will lead to the final state. Let me check each option's path.\n\nTake the first option (A and D): the intermediate state is m'=0. The second transition must go from l=1, m'=0 to l=0, m=0. Let's see if that is allowed. The second transition must also obey the dipole selection rules. Starting from l'=1 to l''=0, so \u0394l = -1, which is allowed. The m must go from m'=0 to m''=0. The selection rules for the second transition require \u0394m = 0 or \u00b11. Here, m changes from 0 to 0, so \u0394m=0. That's allowed. \n\nSimilarly, for option B: intermediate state m'=-1. The second "
    "transition would go from m'=-1 to m''=0. So \u0394m= +1, which is allowed. Similarly for option C, intermediate m'=+1 to m''=0 would have \u0394m = -1, which is allowed. \n\nTherefore, all three paths (A/D, B, C) are allowed in terms of selection rules. But the probabilities will depend on the amplitudes of each path.\n\nAssuming that the first transition splits the amplitude equally among m'=-1,0,+1, then each has a 1/3 chance. Then, each subsequent transition would have their own probabilities. Wait, but maybe the splitting isn't exactly equal because of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. \n\nWait, let's get back to the Clebsch-Gordan part. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining angular momentum. Wait, maybe the angular part of the dipole transition matrix element involves the product of the initial and final spherical harmonics, multiplied by the dipole moment's angular part. The dipole operator's angular part is proportional to the spherical harmonics of l=1. So the angular matrix element is proportional to the integral over Y_{l' m'}^*(Y_{1 m''} Y_{l m}), where m'' is the component of the dipole operator. \n\nAlternatively, using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, the matrix element can be written as:\n\n\u27e8n'l'm'| r |nlm\u27e9 = (-i)^{l'-l} \\sqrt{(l+1)(l'+1)} \\begin{pmatrix} l &1 & l' \\\\ m &0 & -m' \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\langle n'l'||r||nl\\rangle,\n\nwhere the 3j symbol represents the angular part. \n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe a better approach is to remember that when you have an initial state with m=0, the transition probabilities to m'=0, \u00b11 are proportional to the squares of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for coupling l and l'=1. Wait, actually, maybe the angular part is determined by the integral \u27e81 m'' | 0 0; 1 m' - m''\u27e9, but I might be mixing things up here.\n\nAlternatively, the transition probability for the first step from |3,0,0\u27e9 to |2,1,m'\u27e9 is proportional to |\u27e81 m'_dip | 0 0\u27e9|^2, where m'_dip is the m component of the dipole operator. Wait, the dipole operator has three components (x,y,z), which correspond to m'' = -1,0,+1. The total transition amplitude would be the sum over the dipole components. \n\nThe matrix element for the dipole transition is proportional to the sum over m_dip of \u27e8final | Y_{1 m_dip} | initial \u27e9. Since the dipole operator is a vector, its components in spherical harmonics are proportional to Y_{1 m_dip}, so the total matrix element is a sum over m_dip of the matrix elements for each component. \n\nThus, the total transition amplitude squared would be the sum over m_dip of |\u27e8final | Y_{1 m_dip} | initial \u27e9|^2. \n\nCalculating this for the first transition from |3,0,0\u27e9 to |2,1,m'\u27e9:\n\nThe angular part of the matrix element between the two states is \u27e81 m' | Y_{1 m_dip} | 0 0 \u27e9. \n\nThe spherical harmonic Y_{1 m_dip} has l=1, so the product Y_{1 m_dip} Y_{0 0} (since initial l=0) would involve integrating over the angular part. \n\nWait, the initial state is l=0, so Y_{0 0} is spherically symmetric. The final state has l'=1, so the integral becomes:\n\n\u27e81 m' | Y_{1 m_dip} | 0 0\u27e9 = \u222b Y_{1 m'}^*(\u03b8,\u03c6) Y_{1 m_dip}(\u03b8,\u03c6) Y_{0 0}(\u03b8,\u03c6) sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6\n\nBut Y_{0 0} is just a constant (1/sqrt(4\u03c0)), so it pulls out of the integral. Thus, the integral simplifies to:\n\n(1/\u221a(4\u03c0)) \u222b Y_{1 m'}^* Y_{1 m_dip} sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6 \n\nWhich is the integral over the product of two spherical harmonics. Since they form an orthonormal basis, this integral is \u03b4_{m', m_dip} times the integral of |Y_{1 m}|\u00b2, but wait, actually, the integral of Y_{l m}^* Y_{l' m'} is \u03b4_{ll'} \u03b4_{mm'}, so here l'=1 for both, so the integral is \u03b4_{m', m_dip} times the normalization of Y_{1 m}. Since the integral over Y_{1 m}^2 is 1/(4\u03c0) * something? Wait, the integral of |Y_{1 m}|\u00b2 over the sphere is 1. So the integral here would be \u03b4_{m', m_dip} multiplied by 1 (since Y_{0 0} is normalized). Wait, actually, let me compute it properly:\n\nThe integral of Y_{1 m'}^* Y_{1 m_dip} over the sphere is \u03b4_{m', m_dip} multiplied by the normalization factor. Since Y_{l m} are orthonormal, the integral is \u03b4_{m', m_dip} * \u03b4_{1,1} (but since l is fixed here, it's just \u03b4_{m', m_dip}).\n\nTherefore, the integral is \u03b4_{m', m_dip} / sqrt(4\u03c0) * sqrt(4\u03c0) ??? Wait, maybe I messed up the constants. Let me recall that:\n\n\u222b Y_{l m}^*(\u03b8,\u03c6) Y_{l' m'}(\u03b8,\u03c6) sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6 = \u03b4_{l l'} \u03b4_{m m'}\n\nTherefore, the integral above is \u03b4_{m', m_dip} * \u03b4_{1,1} = \u03b4_{m', m_dip}\n\nHence, the matrix element for each m_dip is zero unless m_dip = m'. Therefore, the total matrix element squared would be the sum over m_dip of | ... |\u00b2. Wait, but each term in the sum is non-zero only when m_dip = m', so each m' term is picked up once when m_dip equals m'. \n\nWait, perhaps the total amplitude squared for the transition to a particular m' is proportional to the sum over m_dip of |\u27e8 ... | Y_{1 m_dip} | ... \u27e9 |\u00b2, but since only one term survives (when m_dip = m'), the amplitude squared for each m' is proportional to the square of that single term. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-express the dipole operator in terms of its components. The dipole operator is a vector, so in terms of spherical harmonics, it can be written as:\n\nr = r (sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6, cos\u03b8)\n\nIn spherical harmonics, the components correspond to m = -1, 0, +1. The radial part is just r, so the angular part for each component would be Y_{1 m_dip}.\n\nTherefore, the matrix element for each component (e.g., the z-component, which corresponds to m_dip=0) would have a certain value, and similarly for the x and y components (m_dip=\u00b11). \n\nThe total transition probability is the sum of the squares of the matrix elements for each component. However, when considering transitions to a specific m', only the component of the dipole operator with m_dip = m' contributes to that transition. \n\nWait, let me think again. The transition from |initial\u27e9 (l=0, m=0) to |final\u27e9 (l'=1, m') is allowed if there exists a component of the dipole operator with m_dip such that m_initial + m_dip = m_final. Since m_initial is 0, m_dip must equal m_final. \n\nTherefore, the matrix element for transitioning to m' is proportional to the matrix element of the dipole operator's m'=m_dip component. Since the dipole operator has all three components (m_dip = -1,0,+1), each transition to m' = -1,0,+1 is allowed via the corresponding component. \n\nSince the dipole operator has equal strength in each component (assuming no preferred direction), the probability for each m' should be the same. Therefore, the probabilities for each m' (i.e., m'= -1, 0, +1) should each be 1/3. \n\nTherefore, the first transition from |3,0,0\u27e9 to the intermediate states has probabilities 1/3 each for m'= -1,0,+1. \n\nNow, moving on to the second transition. For each intermediate state, we need to calculate the probability of going from that state to the final |1,0,0\u27e9. Again, applying the same logic.\n\nTake the case of intermediate state |2,1,0\u27e9 (options A and D):\n\nSecond transition: from l'=1, m'=0 to l''=0, m''=0. The selection rules require \u0394l = -1, which is okay, and \u0394m = 0, which is allowed. \n\nThe probability for this transition would again be similar. The matrix element here is from l'=1 to l''=0. The dipole operator component required would have m_dip such that m' + m_dip = m''. Here, m'=0, m''=0 \u21d2 m_dip=0. So only the z-component (m_dip=0) of the dipole operator contributes. \n\nThe transition probability here would be proportional to the square of the matrix element for that component. Since the dipole operator has three components, but only the m_dip=0 contributes here, the total probability for this path (going through m'=0) would be (probability of first transition to m'=0) \u00d7 (probability of second transition from m'=0 to m''=0).\n\nSimilarly, for the intermediate states with m'=+1 (option C):\n\nThe second transition needs to go from m'=+1 to m''=0. This requires \u0394m = -1, so m_dip must be -1 (since m' + m_dip = m'' \u21d2 +1 + m_dip = 0 \u21d2 m_dip = -1). So here, the relevant dipole component is m_dip=-1. \n\nAgain, assuming all components have equal contribution, the transition probability for this path would be (probability of first transition to m'=+1) \u00d7 (probability of second transition from m'=+1 to m''=0). \n\nSame for m'=-1 (option B), needing m_dip=+1 for the second transition. \n\nAssuming that the transition probabilities for each m' in the first step are each 1/3, then the total probability for each path would be:\n\nFor path A/D (through m'=0):\nFirst step: 1/3. Second step: ?\n\nWait, but what about the second step's probability? The second step's transition from |2,1,0\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9 would have its own probability. But similar to the first step, the probability for the second transition from m'=0 to m''=0 would be proportional to the square of the matrix element. \n\nWait, let's analyze the second transition's probability. Let me consider the second transition's angular part. \n\nThe second transition is from |2,1,m'\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9. The angular part of the matrix element would be \u27e80 0 | Y_{1 m_dip} |1 m' \u27e9. Following similar logic as before, this integral is non-zero only when m_dip = 0 - m'? Wait, no. Wait, the condition is that the dipole operator component m_dip must satisfy m' + m_dip = m''. Here, m'' is 0, so m_dip = -m'. \n\nTherefore, the matrix element for the second transition is proportional to the component of the dipole operator with m_dip = -m'. \n\nThe matrix element's magnitude squared would then depend on whether the dipole operator has that component. Since the dipole operator has all three components, each component contributes equally. So the probability for each allowed transition (given the selection rules) is the same as long as the dipole component exists. \n\nTherefore, for the second transition from m'=0 to m''=0, the required m_dip is 0. The probability here would be proportional to the square of the matrix element for the z-component. Since there's only one contributing component (m_dip=0), the probability for this transition is (1/3) [since the dipole operator has three components, but only one contributes here]. Wait, but actually, the probability would be proportional to the square of the matrix element for that component divided by the total possible contributions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probability for each allowed transition is the same. Since in the first transition, the probability for each m' is 1/3, and for each of those, the second transition's probability would also be 1/3? No, that might not be right. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the probability for each path is the product of the probabilities of each step. \n\nLet me denote P1(m') as the probability of the first transition to m', and P2(m', m'') as the probability of the second transition from m' to m''. \n\nWe need to compute P_total = P1(m') * P2(m', 0) summed over all m' that lead to m''=0. \n\nBut in our case, since we are considering specific paths (each path goes through a specific m'), the total probability for each path is indeed P1(m') * P2(m', 0).\n\nNow, for the first step, P1(m') = 1/3 for each allowed m'.\n\nFor the second step, P2(m',0):\n\nWhen going from m' to m''=0, the required m_dip is -m', so the transition is allowed, and the probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element for that component. Since the"
    " dipole operator has equal components, each allowed transition (for a given m') would have the same probability. \n\nHowever, the second transition's probability would also depend on the radial matrix elements, but since all the options are giving probabilities without considering radial parts (they are constants here?), maybe we can assume that the radial parts are the same for all paths? The problem states \"use latex\" but maybe the given probabilities already account for the radial parts. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angular parts determine the relative probabilities. Let me think of the angular part's contribution as a factor. \n\nFor the first transition, the angular part for each m' gives a probability weight of 1/3 each. \n\nFor the second transition, when going from m' to 0, the angular part is only dependent on the existence of the m_dip component. Since each of the m_dip components (for the dipole operator) is present, the probability for each transition (given that it's allowed) is 1/3. \n\nWait, but perhaps the angular matrix elements have different magnitudes. Let me compute them explicitly. \n\nLet me compute the angular part for the second transition from |2,1,m'\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9. The angular matrix element is \u27e80 0 | Y_{1 m_dip} |1 m'\u27e9. \n\nUsing the same logic as before, this integral is \u03b4_{m_dip, -m'}, because:\n\n\u27e80 0 | Y_{1 m_dip} |1 m'\u27e9 = \u222b Y_{0 0}^*(\u03b8,\u03c6) Y_{1 m_dip}(\u03b8,\u03c6) Y_{1 m'}(\u03b8,\u03c6) sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6 \n\nWait, no, actually, the matrix element is \u27e80 0 | Y_{1 m_dip} |1 m'\u27e9. Wait, the ket is |1 m'\u27e9, so the wavefunction is Y_{1 m'}, and the bra is \u27e80 0|, which is Y_{0 0}^*. \n\nThe operator here is Y_{1 m_dip}, so the matrix element is:\n\n\u222b Y_{0 0}^* Y_{1 m_dip} Y_{1 m'} sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6 \n\nThis is similar to a three-Y spherical harmonics integral. \n\nThis integral can be evaluated using the addition theorem or 3j symbols. Alternatively, we can note that this is equivalent to the integral of Y_{1 m_dip} Y_{1 m'} over the sphere, multiplied by Y_{0 0}^*, but since Y_{0 0} is a constant, it just multiplies the integral. \n\nWait, Y_{0 0} is 1/\u221a(4\u03c0), so:\n\nIntegral = (1/\u221a(4\u03c0)) \u222b Y_{1 m_dip} Y_{1 m'} sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6 \n\nThe integral of Y_{1 m_dip} Y_{1 m'} over the sphere is \u03b4_{m_dip, -m'} multiplied by something? Wait, no. Let me recall that:\n\nThe product of two spherical harmonics can be expressed as a sum over spherical harmonics. The integral over the product of three spherical harmonics can be related to the Wigner 3j symbols. \n\nAlternatively, the integral \u222b Y_{l1 m1} Y_{l2 m2} Y_{l3 m3} d\u03a9 is proportional to the 3j symbol:\n\n\u221a[( (2l1+1)(2l2+1)(2l3+1) ) / (4\u03c0)] * \u27e8 l1 l2 l3 | m1 m2 m3 \u27e9 \n\nBut in our case, the integral is \u222b Y_{0 0}^* Y_{1 m_dip} Y_{1 m'} d\u03a9. \n\nHere, l1=0, m1=0; l2=1, m2=m_dip; l3=1, m3=m'. \n\nThe integral would be non-zero only if the sum of the angular momenta can couple to zero. The triangle condition requires that l1 + l2 + l3 must be able to form a closed triangle. Here, 0 +1 +1 can form a triangle, and the total angular momentum must be zero. \n\nThe 3j symbol \u27e8 0 1 1 | 0 m_dip m' \u27e9 is non-zero only if 0 + m_dip + m' = 0, so m' = -m_dip. \n\nAdditionally, the triangle inequality requires that 0 \u2264 l3 \u2264 l1 + l2, etc. Here, since l1=0, l2=1, l3=1, the maximum l3 is l1 + l2 =1, which matches. \n\nTherefore, the integral is proportional to \u03b4_{m' + m_dip, 0} multiplied by some coefficient. \n\nThe exact value can be calculated, but for the purposes of comparing probabilities, we can note that whenever m' = -m_dip, the integral is non-zero, otherwise zero. \n\nTherefore, the matrix element is non-zero only when m_dip = -m'. The value of the matrix element squared would then depend on the 3j symbol. \n\nTo compute the actual value, let's pick specific m' values. Let's take m'=0 first. Then m_dip must be 0. \n\nThe 3j symbol \u27e80 1 1 | 0 0 0\u27e9. Wait, m1 + m2 + m3 = 0 +0 +0 =0, which satisfies the condition. \n\nThe 3j symbol \u27e80 1 1; 0 0 0\u27e9. \n\nThe formula for the 3j symbol is:\n\n\u27e8 l1 l2 l3; m1 m2 m3 \u27e9 = (-1)^{l1-l2+m3} sqrt{ [(l1+l2-l3)! (l1-l2+l3)! (-l1+l2+l3)! ) / ( (l1+l2+l3+1)! ) ] } \u00d7 ... some terms involving Kronecker deltas.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look up the specific value. \n\nAlternatively, using the properties of the 3j symbol, the triangle conditions must be satisfied. Here, l1=0, l2=1, l3=1. The triangle conditions are satisfied. \n\nThe 3j symbol \u27e80 1 1; 0 0 0\u27e9 is known. Let me recall that for the case where l1=0, the 3j symbol simplifies. \n\nThe general expression when one of the l's is 0 is:\n\n\u27e80 l2 l3; 0 m2 m3\u27e9 = \u03b4_{l2,l3} \u03b4_{m2,-m3} \u00d7 sqrt( (2l2 +1)/(4\u03c0) )\n\nWait, maybe not exactly. Alternatively, let me compute it numerically. \n\nThe 3j symbol \u27e80 1 1; 0 0 0\u27e9 is equal to:\n\n( -1 )^{0 +1 -1} * sqrt( ( (0+1-1)! (0-1+1)! (-0+1+1)! ) / ( (0+1+1)! ) (2*0 +1)(2*1+1)(2*1+1) )) ... Hmm, this is getting too complex. Maybe a better way is to note that the integral over Y_{00} Y_{10} Y_{10} would give a certain value. \n\nWait, Y_{00} is 1/\u221a(4\u03c0). Y_{10} is proportional to sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u03b8. \n\nThe product Y_{00}* Y_{10} Y_{10} would be (1/\u221a(4\u03c0)) * (3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u00b2\u03b8. Integrating over the sphere:\n\nIntegral = (1/\u221a(4\u03c0)) * (3/(4\u03c0)) \u222b cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6 \n\nIntegrate \u03c6: 2\u03c0. Integrate \u03b8: \u222b0 to \u03c0 cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 = substitution u=cos\u03b8, du=-sin\u03b8 d\u03b8. Limits from 1 to -1. Integral becomes \u222b1^{-1} u\u00b2 (-du) = \u222b_{-1}^1 u\u00b2 du = [u\u00b3/3] from -1 to 1 = (1/3 - (-1)/3) = 2/3.\n\nSo the integral becomes:\n\n(1/\u221a(4\u03c0)) * (3/(4\u03c0)) * 2\u03c0 * (2/3) \n\nWait, let's compute step by step:\n\nFirst, the product:\n\nY_{00}^* Y_{10} Y_{10} = (1/\u221a(4\u03c0)) * [sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u03b8]^2 \n\n= (1/\u221a(4\u03c0)) * (3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u00b2\u03b8 \n\nThen multiply by sin\u03b8 and integrate over \u03b8 and \u03c6:\n\nIntegral = \u222b0^{2\u03c0} d\u03c6 \u222b0^\u03c0 [ (1/\u221a(4\u03c0)) * (3/(4\u03c0)) cos\u00b2\u03b8 ] sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 \n\n= (1/\u221a(4\u03c0))*(3/(4\u03c0)) * 2\u03c0 * [\u222b0^\u03c0 cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 ]\n\nAs before, the theta integral is 2/3. So:\n\nIntegral = (3/(4\u03c0 * sqrt(4\u03c0))) * 2\u03c0 * (2/3) \n\nWait, let me compute constants step by step:\n\nMultiply constants:\n\n(1/\u221a(4\u03c0)) * (3/(4\u03c0)) * 2\u03c0 \n\n= 3/(4\u03c0) * 2\u03c0 / \u221a(4\u03c0) \n\n= (3 * 2\u03c0) / (4\u03c0 \u221a(4\u03c0))\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n= 6/(4 \u221a(4\u03c0)) \n\nWait, perhaps I made an error here. Let me recast:\n\nThe integral is:\n\n[1/\u221a(4\u03c0)] * [3/(4\u03c0)] * 2\u03c0 * (2/3) \n\nBreaking down:\n\nFirst term: 1/\u221a(4\u03c0)\n\nSecond term: 3/(4\u03c0)\n\nThird term: 2\u03c0 (from phi integral)\n\nFourth term: 2/3 (from theta integral)\n\nMultiply all together:\n\n(1 / \u221a(4\u03c0)) * (3 / 4\u03c0) * 2\u03c0 * (2/3) \n\nThe 3 cancels with the denominator 3, leaving:\n\n(1 / \u221a(4\u03c0)) * (1 / 4\u03c0) * 2\u03c0 * 2 \n\nSimplify:\n\n(1 / \u221a(4\u03c0)) * (2\u03c0 * 2) / (4\u03c0) \n\n= (1 / \u221a(4\u03c0)) * (4\u03c0) / (4\u03c0) \n\n= 1 / \u221a(4\u03c0)\n\nWait, that leaves us with 1/\u221a(4\u03c0). But the integral over the sphere of three spherical harmonics must be dimensionless, but perhaps I missed a factor somewhere. Alternatively, maybe the result is (1/\u221a(4\u03c0)) * ... but perhaps the absolute square is needed here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe this is getting too bogged down. Let's instead note that the matrix element squared for the transition from m'=0 would involve this integral squared. But regardless of the exact value, the key point is that the transition probabilities for the second step depend on the same factors. \n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for the first transition, the probabilities to each m' are equal (1/3 each). For the second transition, the probability from each m' to the final state is also the same, because of symmetry. For example, going from m'=0 requires the z-component, which is one component. Going from m'=+1 requires the -1"
    " component, which is another component, but since all components are equally probable, the transition probabilities would be the same. \n\nTherefore, each of the three paths (through m'=-1, 0, +1) would have the same total probability: (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9 each. But since there are three such paths, the total probability would be 3*(1/9)=1/3. However, the problem states that the transition occurs via two dipole transitions, implying that it must take one of the paths, so each path has a probability of 1/3. But looking at the options, none of them have 1/3 for a single path except option D, which has 1/3. But wait, perhaps my assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, hold on! The problem states that the decay occurs via two dipole transitions. So the total probability is the sum over all possible paths. But the question is asking for the transition route and the corresponding probability. Each possible path (each intermediate m') has its own probability. The options list specific paths and their probabilities. So for example, the path through m'=0 (options A and D) has probability (1/3)*(something). What is the \"something\"?\n\nAh, here's the mistake: In the second step, the transition from the intermediate state to the final state may have a different probability depending on the m'. For instance, the path through m'=0 might have a higher probability than the others because the angular matrix element is larger. \n\nWait, in the case of m'=0, the second transition requires the dipole's z-component (m_dip=0), whereas for m'=+1, it requires the m_dip=-1 component. The matrix element for each of these might have different magnitudes. \n\nLet me think of the angular matrix elements for the second step. Let's compute the square of the matrix element for the second transition from m'=0 versus m'=+1. \n\nSuppose the angular part of the second transition's matrix element is proportional to the integral we discussed earlier. For m'=0, the integral was (1/\u221a(4\u03c0)) multiplied by some factors. Let's compute the squared matrix elements for m'=0 and m'=+1.\n\nCase 1: Second transition from m'=0 to m''=0 (path A/D):\n\nThe matrix element squared would be proportional to the square of the integral we computed earlier, which was 1/\u221a(4\u03c0) times other constants. But let's see if we can compare the squared terms between m'=0 and m'=1.\n\nCase 2: Transition from m'=+1 to m''=0 (path C):\n\nHere, the dipole component needed is m_dip=-1. Let's compute the analogous integral. \n\nThe integral would be:\n\n\u27e80 0 | Y_{1,-1} |1, +1\u27e9 \n\nFollowing the same method as before, this would be:\n\n\u222b Y_{0 0}^* Y_{1,-1} Y_{1,+1} d\u03a9 \n\nY_{1,-1} is proportional to e^{-i\u03c6} sin\u03b8 e^{-i\u03c6} ? Wait, the exact form isn't crucial. The important thing is the integral's value. \n\nThe product Y_{1,-1} Y_{1,+1} would have terms involving e^{-i\u03c6} * e^{i\u03c6} = e^0, so the angle dependence might cancel out the \u03c6 dependence. \n\nAlternatively, using the same 3j symbol approach. For m'=+1, m_dip must be -1 to get m''=0. So the 3j symbol is \u27e80 1 1; 0 -1 +1\u27e9. \n\nThe sum of the m's must be zero: 0 + (-1) + (+1) =0, so that's okay. \n\nThe 3j symbol \u27e80 1 1; 0 -1 1\u27e9. \n\nUsing properties of 3j symbols, swapping columns (since 3j symbols are invariant under even permutations), this is the same as \u27e80 1 1; 0 1 -1\u27e9, which is the same as the previous case but with m_dip and m' swapped. \n\nAlternatively, the value of the 3j symbol \u27e80 1 1; 0 -1 1\u27e9 can be calculated. Let me recall that:\n\n\u27e80 1 1; 0 -1 1\u27e9 = ?\n\nThere's a formula for 3j symbols when one of the l's is zero. \n\nThe general formula for \u27e80 l2 l3; 0 m2 m3\u27e9 is \u03b4_{l2,l3} \u03b4_{m2,-m3} multiplied by sqrt( (2l2 +1)/(4\u03c0) ). \n\nWait, if that's the case, then:\n\nFor l2=1, l3=1, m2=-1, m3=+1, then \u03b4_{1,1}=1, \u03b4_{-1, -1}= yes, since m3 = +1, so m2 must be -m3? Wait, m2 should be -m3. Wait m2 = -m3?\n\nYes, the delta function is \u03b4_{m2, -m3}. Here, m2 = -1, m3=+1, so m2 = -m3, so that's satisfied. Therefore the 3j symbol would be sqrt( (2*1 +1)/(4\u03c0) ) = sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)). \n\nSimilarly, for the case of m'=0, m_dip=0, m3=0:\n\n\u27e80 1 1; 0 0 0\u27e9 would be sqrt( (2*1 +1)/(4\u03c0) ) as well? Wait, but in this case, m2 = m_dip=0, m3=0, so m2 = -m3? No, because m3 is 0 here. Wait, perhaps the formula is slightly different when m3 is zero. \n\nWait, let me check the formula again. When one of the l's is zero, say l1=0, then the 3j symbol \u27e80 l2 l3; 0 m2 m3\u27e9 is non-zero only if l2=l3 and m2 = -m3. \n\nThen the value is sqrt( (2l2 +1)/(4\u03c0) ) multiplied by some sign? \n\nWait according to the formula here (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-j_symbol#Special_cases), when l1=0:\n\n\u27e80 l2 l3; 0 m2 m3\u27e9 = \u03b4_{l2,l3} \u03b4_{m2,-m3} * sqrt( (2l2+1)/(4\u03c0) )\n\nSo for our cases:\n\nCase 1: l2=1, l3=1, m2=0, m3=0. \n\nBut here, m2 must equal -m3. But m2=0 and m3=0, so yes, that's okay. So the 3j symbol is sqrt( (3)/(4\u03c0) ). \n\nWait but m2 here is m_dip, which is 0, and m3 is m', which is 0. So yes, the condition holds. \n\nTherefore the 3j symbol is sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)). \n\nSimilarly, for case 2 (m'=+1, m_dip=-1):\n\n\u27e80 1 1; 0 -1 1\u27e9 = sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)). \n\nSo the 3j symbols for both cases (m'=0 and m'=1) have the same magnitude. \n\nTherefore, the matrix elements for both transitions (from m'=0 and m'=\u00b11) have the same magnitude. Hence, their squared probabilities are equal. \n\nTherefore, the angular part contributes equally to each path. \n\nThus, each path (through m'=0, m'=+1, m'=-1) has a probability of (1/3) (first step) multiplied by (1/3) (second step), totaling 1/9 each. However, since there are three such paths, the total probability for the entire decay process would be 3*(1/9) = 1/3. But the question specifies the decay via two dipole transitions, and asks for the probability of a specific path. \n\nLooking back at the options, each path's probability is the product of the two steps' probabilities. Since each step's probability for the specific m' is 1/3 each time, then each path has probability (1/3)*(1/3) = 1/9. But the options don't have 1/9. Wait, this suggests I might have misunderstood the setup. \n\nWait, perhaps the total probability for the entire process (summing over all paths) is 1/3, but each individual path has a probability of 1/9. However, the question says \"the transition route and the corresponding probability\", implying that each path has a certain probability. But the options give different probabilities. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first step has probabilities weighted by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, not equally. Let me revisit the first step's probabilities. \n\nEarlier, I assumed that the first transition's probabilities were equally divided (1/3 each), but perhaps that's incorrect. Let me recalculate the first step's probabilities properly. \n\nThe first transition is from |3,0,0\u27e9 to |2,1,m'\u27e9. The angular part of the matrix element is \u27e81 m' | Y_{1 m_dip} |0 0\u27e9. \n\nAs before, the integral is \u03b4_{m', m_dip} multiplied by the normalization. \n\nThe total probability for all possible m' is the sum over m_dip of |\u27e81 m' | Y_{1 m_dip} |0 0\u27e9 |^2 summed over m' and m_dip? Wait, no. Actually, the total probability is the sum over all possible final m' of the probabilities for each m'. \n\nThe total transition probability is the sum over m' of |\u27e82,1,m' | r |3,0,0\u27e9 |^2. \n\nEach term in this sum is |\u27e81 m' | Y_{1 m_dip} |0 0\u27e9 |^2 (angular part) multiplied by the radial matrix element squared (which we can assume is the same for all m'). \n\nThe sum over m' of |\u27e81 m' | Y_{1 m_dip} |0 0\u27e9 |^2 summed over m_dip would be... Wait, actually, the total probability is the sum over m' of the sum over m_dip of |\u27e81 m' | Y_{1 m_dip} |0 0\u27e9 |^2. \n\nWait, no. The total matrix element for the transition to any m' is the sum over m_dip of \u27e8final | Y_{1 m_dip} | initial \u27e9. \n\nWait, the total transition amplitude is:\n\n\u27e82,1,m' | r |3,0,0\u27e9 = sum_{m_dip} \u27e82,1,m' | Y_{1 m_dip} |3,0,0\u27e9 \n\nBut the radial part would be the same for all m_dip, so let's denote it as R. \n\nThe angular part for each m_dip is \u27e81 m' | Y_{1 m_dip} |0 0\u27e9, so the amplitude squared is |R|^2 * |sum_{m_dip} \u27e81 m' | Y_{1 m_dip} |0 0\u27e9 |^2. \n\nWait, no. The total amplitude for a specific m' is the sum over m_dip of the matrix elements for each dipole component. \n\nThus, the amplitude squared is:\n\n|R|^2 * | sum_{m_dip} \u27e81 m' | Y_{1 m_dip} |0 0\u27e9 |^2 \n\nBut the matrix element \u27e81 m' | Y_{1 m_dip} |0 0\u27e9 is zero unless m_dip = m', as before. \n\nTherefore, the sum over m_dip reduces to a single term when m_dip = m', so the amplitude squared is |R|^2 * |\u27e81 m' | Y_{1 m'} |0 0\u27e9 |^2 \n\nThe angular part \u27e81 m' | Y_{1 m'} |0 0\u27e9 is the same as before. \n\nThe integral \u27e81 m' | Y_{1 m'} |0 0\u27e9 is:\n\n\u222b Y_{1 m'}^* Y_{1 m'} Y_{0 0} d\u03a9 \n\nWait, Y_{00} is 1/sqrt(4\u03c0), so:\n\nIntegral = (1/sqrt(4\u03c0)) \u222b |Y_{1 m'}|^2 d\u03a9 \n\nBut the integral of |Y_{1 m'}|^2 over the sphere is 1, so the integral is 1/sqrt(4\u03c0). \n\nTherefore, the amplitude squared is |R|^2 * (1/(4\u03c0)) \n\nWait, no, the integral is (1/sqrt(4\u03c0)) * 1, so the angular part is 1/sqrt(4\u03c0). Therefore, the squared amplitude is |R|^2 * (1/(4\u03c0)). \n\nWait, but this is the same for all m'? Because the angular part is 1/sqrt(4\u03c0) regardless of m'? \n\nYes! Because the integral over |Y_{1 m'}|^2 is always 1, so the angular part squared is (1/sqrt(4\u03c0))^2 = 1/(4\u03c0). \n\nTherefore, the amplitude squared for each m' is the same, meaning each m' has the same probability. \n\nTherefore, the probabilities for the first transition to each m' are indeed equal, each with probability 1/3. \n\nSimilarly, the second transition's probabilities for each path are also equal. \n\nTherefore, each path (through m'=0, m'=+1, or m'=-1) has a total probability of (1/3)*(1/3) = 1/9. However, the options do not have 1/9. This suggests an error in my reasoning. \n\nWait, looking at the options:\n\n(A) ... and 2/3\n\n(B) ... and 1/4\n\n(C) ... and 1/4\n\n(D) ... and 1/3\n\nHmm, 1/3 is option D. But according to my calculation, each path has 1/9, but the total probability for all paths is 1/3, so the question must be referring to the total probability of the path, not the total decay probability. \n\nWait, the question says \"the transition route and the corresponding probability\". So each possible path has a probability of 1/9, but the options list probabilities like 1/3 or 1/4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the second step's probability is also 1/3. Perhaps the second step's probability isn't 1/3 but something else. \n\nWait, in the second step, the transition from |2,1,m'\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9 has an angular matrix element that is the same for all m'? \n\nEarlier, we saw that the angular part of the second transition's matrix element squared is (3/(4\u03c0)) * ... but the radial part might vary. However, the problem doesn't give us radial matrix elements, so perhaps the probabilities are purely based on the angular parts, and the radial parts are the same for all paths. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total probability is the sum over all paths, but the question is asking for the probability of a specific path. \n\nWait, the problem states that the decay happens via two dipole transitions, so it must proceed through one of the paths. The question is asking which of the paths listed has the correct probability. \n\nGiven that each path has probability 1/9, but none of the options show that, I must have gone wrong somewhere. \n\nWait, maybe I forgot to consider that the first transition's probability is not 1/3 per m', but weighted by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. \n\nWait, let's think of the first transition using the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The matrix element for the dipole transition is:\n\n\u27e82,1,m' | r |3,0,0\u27e9 = (-i)^{1-0} \\sqrt{(0+1)(1+1)} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 &1 &1 \\\\ 0 &0 & -m' \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\langle 2,1 || r || 3,0 \\rangle \n\nWait, the 3j symbol here is:\n\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0 &1 &1 \\\\ 0 &0 &-m' \\end{pmatrix}\n\nThe 3j symbol is non-zero only if the sum of the lower indices is zero: 0 +0 + (-m') =0 \u21d2 m'=0. \n\nWait, that contradicts earlier conclusions. Wait, this would mean that only m'=0 is allowed? But that can't be, because the dipole transition allows \u0394m=0,\u00b11. \n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the Wigner-Eckart theorem. Let me check the formula again. \n\nThe Wigner-Eckart theorem states that:\n\n\u27e8J' M' | T_q | J M \u27e9 = \\langle J M | T_q | J' M' \u27e9 = (-1)^{J - M} \\sqrt{ (2J' +1)(2J +1) } \\begin{pmatrix} J & 1 & J' \\\\ -M & q & M' \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\langle J' || T || J \u27e9 \n\nWhere T is a tensor operator of rank 1 (since dipole is rank 1). \n\nIn our case, the dipole operator is a rank 1 tensor operator. The matrix element \u27e82,1,m' | r |3,0,0\u27e9 corresponds to T_q being the component of the dipole operator with q = m' - m_initial. Since m_initial is 0, q = m'. \n\nWait, the general formula would be:\n\n\u27e8n', l'=1, m' | r |n, l=0, m=0\u27e9 = \n\n(-1)^{l - m} \\sqrt{(2l' +1)(2l +1)} \\begin{pmatrix} l &1 & l' \\\\ m & q & -m' \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\langle n',l' || r || n,l \u27e9 \n\nWait, perhaps the exact form is tricky. Let me set variables:\n\nLet J = l =0, M = m =0 \n\nJ' = l' =1, M' = m'\n\nq is the component of the dipole operator, which is related to the m difference. \n\nThe matrix element is:\n\n\u27e8J' M' | T_q | J M\u27e9 = \n\n(-1)^{J - M} \\sqrt{(2J' +1)(2J +1)} \\begin{pmatrix} J &1 & J' \\\\ -M & q & M' \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\langle J' || T || J \u27e9 \n\nSetting J=0, M=0, J'=1, M'=m', q = ?\n\nThe component q of the dipole operator must satisfy the relation from the Wigner-Eckart theorem's 3j symbol. \n\nThe 3j symbol requires that the sum of the lower indices equals zero:\n\n-J + q + M' =0 \u21d2 q = J - M' = 0 - M' \n\nWait, the lower indices are -M, q, M', so their sum must be zero:\n\n- M + q + M' =0 \u21d2 q = M - M' \n\nBut since M=0, q = -M' \n\nTherefore, the component of the dipole operator needed is q = -M' \n\nTherefore, the matrix element is proportional to the 3j symbol:\n\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0 &1 &1 \\\\ 0 & -m' & m' \\end{pmatrix}\n\nBecause q = -m' \n\nLet's write out the 3j symbol:\n\n\u27e80 1 1; 0 -m' m' \u27e9 \n\nThis must satisfy the triangle conditions. \n\nThe sum of the upper indices: 0+1+1 = 2, which is even. \n\nThe sum of the lower indices: 0 + (-m') + m' =0, which is okay. \n\nThe triangle inequalities:\n\n0 \u22641 \u22640+1 \u21d2 1 \u22641 (equality holds)\n\n1 \u22640+1 \u21d2 1 \u22641 (equality holds)\n\n1 \u22641+0 \u21d2 same \n\nSo the 3j symbol is non-zero. \n\nThe value of the 3j symbol \u27e80 1 1; 0 -m' m'\u27e9 can be calculated. \n\nUsing the formula from Wikipedia for 3j symbols when one l is zero:\n\n\u27e80 1 1; 0 -m' m'\u27e9 = \u03b4_{m', -(-m')} ? Wait, no. \n\nWait, using the special case formula mentioned earlier:\n\n\u27e80 l2 l3; 0 m2 m3\u27e9 = \u03b4_{l2,l3} \u03b4_{m2, -m3} * sqrt( (2l2 +1)/(4\u03c0) )\n\nHere, l2=1, l3=1, m2 = -m', m3 = m' \n\nThus, the condition is \u03b4_{m2, -m3} \u21d2 -m' = -m' \u2192 yes. \n\nTherefore, the 3j symbol is sqrt( (2*1 +1)/(4\u03c0) ) = sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)). \n\nTherefore, the matrix element squared is proportional to [sqrt(3/(4\u03c0))]^2 = 3/(4\u03c0). \n\nBut this is the same for all m'! Because the 3j symbol's magnitude is the same regardless of m' (as long as the conditions are met). \n\nTherefore, the angular part of the matrix element squared is the same for all m', meaning that each transition to m' has the same probability. \n\nTherefore, the first transition's probabilities are equally divided among m' = -1, 0, +1, each with probability 1/3. \n\nSimilarly, for the second transition, the angular part's contribution is the same for each path. \n\n"
    "Therefore, each path (through m'=0, \u00b11) has probability (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9. But the options don't include this. \n\nHmm, now I'm confused. The options are A to D, with probabilities like 2/3, 1/4, 1/3. \n\nPerhaps I've missed that the total probability is the sum over all paths, which is 1/3, but the question wants the probability of the specific path given in the option. \n\nWait, the problem states that the decay occurs via two dipole transitions. So the total probability is the sum over all possible paths, but each path's probability is 1/9. However, the options give specific routes with their probabilities. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D says the path through m'=0 has probability 1/3. \n\nIf the total probability of all paths is 1/3, then perhaps the question is asking for the total probability of the decay, not the individual path probabilities. But the wording says \"the transition route and the corresponding probability\", implying per route. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the second transition's probability is also 1/3. Let me reevaluate the second transition's probabilities. \n\nThe second transition from |2,1,m'\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9:\n\nThe matrix element squared is proportional to the angular part squared. Using the Wigner-Eckart theorem again. \n\nThe matrix element \u27e81,0,0 | r |2,1,m'\u27e9 \n\nHere, J = l'=1, M = m'\n\nJ'=0, M'=0 \n\nThe dipole operator component needed is q = M' - M = 0 - m'\n\nThus, q = -m'\n\nThe matrix element is:\n\n\u27e80 0 | r |1 m'\u27e9 = \n\n(-1)^{1 - m'} \\sqrt{(2*0 +1)(2*1 +1)} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 &1 &0 \\\\ m' & -m' & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \u00d7 \\langle 0 || r ||1 \u27e9 \n\nWait, the 3j symbol here is \u27e81 1 0; m' -m' 0 \u27e9 \n\nApplying the special case formula for when one of the l's is 0 (here l3=0):\n\n\u27e8l1 l2 0; m1 m2 0 \u27e9 = \u03b4_{l1,l2} \u03b4_{m1,-m2} \u00d7 sqrt( (2l1 +1)/(4\u03c0) )\n\nHere, l1=1, l2=1, m1=m', m2=-m' \n\nThus, the 3j symbol is sqrt( (3)/(4\u03c0) ), same as before. \n\nTherefore, the angular part is the same for all m', so each second transition has the same probability. \n\nThus, the probability for each path is (1/3)*(1/3)=1/9. \n\nBut the options don't have this. So perhaps my approach is missing something. \n\nWait, maybe the first step's probabilities are not equally divided. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the initial state is |3,0,0\u27e9 and the first transition is to |2,1,m'\u27e9. The dipole transition matrix element's angular part is proportional to the 3j symbol we calculated, which was the same for all m'. \n\nTherefore, the probabilities for each m' are equal, so each has probability 1/3. \n\nSimilarly, the second transition's probabilities are also equal, so each path has probability 1/9. \n\nHowever, the options give different probabilities. This discrepancy suggests that perhaps the angular matrix elements aren't the same for all m'. \n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the radial matrix elements. The radial parts might differ between the transitions, leading to different probabilities. \n\nThe problem statement says \"use latex\", but maybe the probabilities given in the options already account for the radial parts. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first transition from n=3 to n=2 has a different radial matrix element compared to the second transition from n=2 to n=1. \n\nBut even so, the question asks for the probability of the specific path. The total probability would be the product of the two steps' probabilities. \n\nSuppose the radial parts are such that the first transition has a certain probability and the second another, but the angular parts still make the probabilities for each m' equal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first transition has a total probability of, say, P1, and the second P2, so the total is P1*P2. But without knowing the radial parts, I can't compute that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the dipole transitions' probabilities are governed solely by the angular selection rules and the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, and the probabilities are determined by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for each step. \n\nWait, perhaps the first transition has Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the combination of l=0 and l'=1. Wait, no, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are for combining angular momenta. \n\nAlternatively, the probability for each path is the product of the squared Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for each step. \n\nWait, maybe the first transition's probability for each m' is the square of the CG coefficient for coupling l=0 and l'=1 to get m'=m_initial + m_dip. \n\nWait, perhaps the initial state is a pure l=0, so the first transition's probability for each m' is the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for |l=1, m'> composed from l_initial=0 and the dipole's angular part. \n\nWait, the dipole operator's angular part is l=1, so the transition is like adding l=0 and l=1 to get l'=1. \n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for |1 m'> = |0 0; 1 m'> would be sqrt((2*1 +1)/(4\u03c0)) \u03b4_{m',0} ? \n\nNo, that doesn't seem right. \n\nAlternatively, the CG coefficient for combining l1=0 and l2=1 to get L=1 and M=m' is given by:\n\n\u27e8 l1 l2 L | m1 m2 M \u27e9 \n\nHere, l1=0, m1=0; l2=1, m2 must be m'; L=1, M=m'. \n\nThe CG coefficient is \u27e80 1 1 | 0 m' m' \u27e9 \n\nUsing the CG coefficient formula, when l1=0, the CG coefficient is \u03b4_{L,l2} \u03b4_{M,m2} times sqrt((2L+1)/(4\u03c0)). \n\nWait, so \u27e80 1 1 | 0 m' m' \u27e9 = sqrt( (2*1 +1)/(4\u03c0) ) \u03b4_{m', m'} \n\nWhich is sqrt(3/(4\u03c0)), so the square is 3/(4\u03c0). \n\nBut this is the same for any m', so the probabilities are equal. \n\nThus, the first step's probabilities are equal, each 1/3. \n\nSame for the second step. \n\nThus, the total probability for each path is 1/9, but the options don't have that. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the sum over all possible paths, and the probability listed is the total probability. For example, the path through m'=0 has a probability of 1/3 (the total probability), but that's not indicated in the options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first transition's probabilities are not equally divided. Let me think differently. \n\nThe first transition from |3,0,0\u27e9 to |2,1,m'\u27e9. The possible m' are -1,0,+1. The probability for each is proportional to the square of the matrix element. \n\nThe matrix element for m'=0 is proportional to the z-component of the dipole operator, which is Y_{10}. The matrix element for m'=+1 is proportional to Y_{1+1}, and similarly for m'=-1. \n\nThe angular integrals for these matrix elements are all the same, as previously computed, so their squared magnitudes are equal. \n\nTherefore, the probabilities are indeed equal. \n\nHmm, perhaps the answer is option D, which has probability 1/3. Because the total probability for the entire decay via any path is 1/3, and the question might be asking for the total probability of the path through |2,1,0\u27e9, which is one of three paths each with 1/9, but that sums to 1/3. \n\nWait, but the question says \"the transition route and the corresponding probability\". So if the path is via |2,1,0\u27e9, then its probability is 1/3 (summing over all paths), but that's not correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first transition from 3\u21922 has a total probability of 2/3, and the second from 2\u21921 has 1/2, making the total 1/3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first transition's probability is 2/3, and the second is 1/2, leading to 1/3. \n\nWait, but why? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dipole selection rules for the first transition from l=0 to l=1 allow three possible m' values, so the probability is spread equally (each 1/3). The second transition from l=1 to l=0 also has three possible m' values (since m' can be -1,0,+1 and the final m is 0, so m_dip must be 1,0,-1 respectively). But the second transition is from a specific m', so for example, if the intermediate is m'=0, then only the m_dip=0 component contributes, giving a probability of 1/3 (since there are three components but only one contributes). \n\nTherefore, the total probability for the path through m'=0 is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9. \n\nBut option D says probability 1/3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first step has a probability of 2/3 (since there are three paths but the question's options don't mention the other paths). \n\nWait, perhaps the first transition from 3\u21922 has a probability of 2/3, and the second from 2\u21921 has 1/2, leading to 2/3 * 1/2 = 1/3. \n\nBut why would the first transition have 2/3 probability? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the total probability for the first transition is 2/3 (since it can go to any l=1 state, and the radial matrix element's squared summed over m' gives 2/3 of the total possible transitions?), but this is speculation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first transition's total probability is 2/3 (because the dipole transition from n=3 to n=2 has a certain probability, and then to n=1 another). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the first transition has a probability "
    "of 2/3 (due to the radial integral) and the second has 1/2, leading to 1/3. \n\nGiven that option D has probability 1/3 and the path through |2,1,0\u27e9, which is one of the paths, this might be the intended answer. \n\nAlternatively, another approach: the total angular momentum change must satisfy \u0394L =0 overall (since initial and final L are both 0). So the two steps must have \u0394L = +1 and -1, or vice versa. \n\nThe path through |2,1,0\u27e9 has \u0394L=+1 then -1. The other paths also do that. \n\nThe probability might be calculated as follows: \n\nThe first transition has three possible m' states, each with probability 1/3. The second transition from each of these has probability 1/3 (since three possible m'' but only one leads to final state). \n\nThus total for each path is 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9. \n\nBut the options don't have this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first transition's probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element, which for m'=0 is different. \n\nWait, let me recompute the angular parts with actual values. \n\nFirst transition's matrix element squared for m'=0: \n\nThe integral we did earlier was 1/\u221a(4\u03c0) * ... \n\nWait, let's compute the squared matrix element for the first transition to m'=0: \n\nThe angular part is \u27e80 0 | Y_{10} |10\u27e9. \n\nWait, no, the matrix element is \u27e810 | Y_{10} |00\u27e9. \n\nWait, the matrix element for the first step to m'=0 is:\n\n\u27e82,1,0 | r |3,0,0\u27e9 = \u27e810 | Y_{10} |00\u27e9 * R \n\nThe angular part is \u27e810 | Y_{10} |00\u27e9 = \u222b Y_{10}^* Y_{10} Y_{00} d\u03a9 \n\nWait, Y_{00} is 1/sqrt(4\u03c0), so:\n\n= (1/sqrt(4\u03c0)) \u222b |Y_{10}|^2 d\u03a9 = (1/sqrt(4\u03c0)) * 1 \n\nThus, the angular part is 1/sqrt(4\u03c0). \n\nThe squared angular part is 1/(4\u03c0). \n\nFor m'=+1:\n\n\u27e82,1,+1 | r |3,0,0\u27e9 = \u27e81+1 | Y_{1+1} |00\u27e9 * R \n\nAngular part is \u222b Y_{1+1}^* Y_{1+1} Y_{00} d\u03a9 \n\n= (1/sqrt(4\u03c0)) \u222b |Y_{1+1}|^2 d\u03a9 = same as above, 1/sqrt(4\u03c0). \n\nThus, the squared angular parts are the same for all m', so probabilities are equal. \n\nThus, each path has probability 1/9. \n\nThe options don't have this. \n\nWait, perhaps the question considers the sum over all possible paths as the total probability, and the given options have the total probability. \n\nThe total probability is 3*(1/9)=1/3, so option D's probability of 1/3 would be the total probability for the entire process, but the question says \"the transition route and the corresponding probability\". \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question assumes that the first transition has a probability of 2/3 (because the radial part contributes), and the second step from |2,1,0\u27e9 has a probability of 1/2 (since there are two possible m'' states?), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the probability for the first transition from n=3 to n=2 is 2/3 (sum over all possible m'), and the second transition from n=2 to n=1 is 1/2 (sum over m''?), leading to total 2/3 * 1/2 = 1/3. \n\nThis matches option D. \n\nPerhaps the question assumes that the radial matrix elements are such that the first transition has a total probability of 2/3 (over all m') and the second has 1/2 (over all m''), so the combined probability is 1/3 for the path through |2,1,0\u27e9. \n\nAlternatively, the first transition has a probability of 2/3 (since the dipole transition from n=3 to n=2 is allowed, and the radial part contributes 2/3 of the total probability for the first step), then the second step has probability 1/2 (since from n=2 to n=1, there are two possible paths (m'=\u00b11 and 0?), but only one leads to the final state). \n\nWait, no, from n=2, l=1, to n=1, l=0, the possible m' are the same. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first transition has a probability of 2/3 (summing over all possible m'), and the second transition has probability 1/2 (because there are two possible paths leading to the final state?), but this is unclear. \n\nGiven that option D is the only one with probability 1/3 and the path through |2,1,0\u27e9, which is a valid path, I think the intended answer is D. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of another approach. The total angular momentum change must be zero. \n\nThe two transitions must have \u0394l = +1 and -1. \n\nThe first transition is l=0\u21921, second l=1\u21920. \n\nThe m-values must also add up to zero. \n\nThe total probability is the sum over all paths. \n\nEach path's probability is (1/3) * (1/3) =1/9. \n\nThe total is 3*(1/9)=1/3. \n\nIf the question is asking for the probability of the specific path (A or D), then it's 1/9, but since that's not an option, perhaps they consider the total probability. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first transition's probability is 2/3 (because the radial part contributes) and the second is 1/2, giving 1/3. \n\nGiven that option D is the only one with 1/3, I'll go with D.\n</think>\n\nThe decay from \\( |3,0,0\\rangle \\) to \\( |1,0,0\\rangle \\) via two dipole transitions must follow selection rules \\( \\Delta l = \\pm 1 \\) and \\( \\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1 \\).
